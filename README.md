# Herdr Mobile Relay

[![check](https://github.com/0cv/herdr-mobile-relay/actions/workflows/check.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/0cv/herdr-mobile-relay/actions/workflows/check.yml)

Control [Herdr](https://herdr.dev) agents from your phone. Each Linux or macOS
computer runs its own relay; the phone connects to them and merges every agent
into one installable web app.

**Current version:** [`0.21.0`](https://github.com/jochavez/herdr-mobile-relay/releases/tag/v0.21.0) · [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Native Windows is not supported. WSL2 may work but is not tested.

> [!WARNING]
> 0.20.0 replaces the shared relay key with per-device credentials and a new
> encrypted transport. It cannot be installed through the phone updater:
> [upgrade the relay manually and pair every phone again](docs/updates.md#upgrading-from-v0191).

## Get started in two minutes

Requirements: Herdr 0.7.5 or newer, Git, and `curl`.

```bash
herdr plugin install 0cv/herdr-mobile-relay
```

The setup menu opens automatically after installation.

To reopen the main setup menu later:

```bash
herdr plugin pane open \
  --plugin herdr-mobile-relay.events \
  --entrypoint setup \
  --placement zoomed \
  --focus
```

Start with **Community WebRTC Gateway**. It is the recommended path: as fast
to set up as the temporary tunnel, with stable relay connectivity and no
Cloudflare account, domain, `cloudflared`, or tunnel configuration. If prompted,
choose the installed Herdr app that should host the phone UI. The relay starts
and prints a QR code.

**Temporary Cloudflare Tunnel** is the fastest getting-started option for a
one-computer trial. It installs any missing user-level tools with confirmation,
starts the relay and bundled app, and prints a QR code.

Scan the QR with your phone. Keep the pane open; Ctrl-C stops the relay.

Neither quick-start path needs `sudo` or a Python, Node.js, or Go toolchain.
Treat the QR and its setup link as secrets: they carry the relay key.

[QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) has pairing detail and troubleshooting for both
paths.

## What you get

| Agents | Terminal | Pairing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| <img src="images/home.jpeg" alt="Agents grouped by workspace and worktree across computers" width="260"> | <img src="images/terminal.jpeg" alt="Mobile terminal with Copy, Speak, attachments, and terminal keys" width="260"> | <img src="images/devices-qr.jpeg" alt="One-use device invitation shown as a QR code" width="260"> |

- Monitor and control agents across several computers, grouped by status and
  Herdr workspace, with agents that need input pinned on top.
- Answer approvals and structured plan questions from Codex, Claude Code,
  Qoder, OpenCode, Oh My Pi, and Pi.
- Send prompts, terminal keys, and slash commands; attach screenshots, photos,
  and documents in cancellable batches.
- Read and search each agent's native conversation, including OpenCode and Oh
  My OpenCode plans; inspect workspace files, images, and Git diffs read-only.
- Manage workspaces and Git worktrees; start, rename, clear, and stop agents.
- Have the relay read responses aloud, even with the screen off.
- Pair every phone as its own named device — controller or read-only reader —
  each with its own notification rules, and revoke any of them.

**New in 0.20.0:** named controller and reader devices with QR pairing,
relay-synthesized speech in five languages, per-device notification categories
with settle delay, cooldown, and snooze, multi-file attachments, and OpenCode /
Oh My OpenCode conversations.

## Mobile onboarding

The walkthrough follows setup from scanning the QR through the agent list,
terminal controls, and notification settings.

## Choosing how your phone connects

The setup menu exposes each complete connection path directly:

| Choice | Needs | Best for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Community gateway | no account, domain, or tunnel configuration; an installed app origin | the recommended stable, no-configuration relay path |
| Cloudflare tunnel | nothing for a temporary URL; a Cloudflare account and domain for a permanent hostname | the fastest one-computer trial or a permanent background service |
| Your own gateway | a small VPS | dedicated bandwidth and control of the transport logs |

All three are end-to-end encrypted. On either gateway the phone and the computer
then negotiate a direct peer-to-peer connection, leaving the gateway with the
fallback; Cloudflare tunnel traffic stays on Cloudflare.

- **[Permanent Cloudflare tunnel →](docs/cloudflare-tunnel.md)**

## Agents with a non-default config directory

The relay runs as a background service and does not see a pane's
`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`, or similar. If an agent's
conversation shows as unavailable or a profile's slash commands are missing,
point the relay at that profile with `HERDR_*_CONFIG_DIRS`:

## Security in one paragraph

Prompts, terminal output, uploads, and push details are encrypted end to end
between the phone and the relay. Whatever carries the traffic — a Cloudflare
tunnel or a gateway — observes connection metadata only, never plaintext; on the
direct path no application data reaches it at all, though a gateway still
answers address discovery. Paired credentials distinguish controller and
reader devices, mutations default to controller-only, attachment references
stay bound to the terminal and agent session that created them, and the app can
require device verification before it reconnects.
